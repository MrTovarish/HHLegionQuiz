# HHLegionQuiz
My personal project to recreate the Horus Heresy Legion Choice Quiz

Games Workshop released a "buzzfeed" style quiz at the launch of the new edition of the Horus Heresy tabletop game. 
The quiz was designed to ask you questions, and determine which of the 18 Legions you "belong" to.
The quiz was buggy, had infinite loops, crappy questions, and sometimes frustrating results.
My goal is to recreate the quiz from scratch and host it so that my Warhammer loving friends can get what they deserve!
